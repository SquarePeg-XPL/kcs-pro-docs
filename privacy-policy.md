# Privacy Policy - KCS Pro

**Last Updated:** November 15, 2025

## Overview

KCS Pro is a Confluence Cloud app built on Atlassian Forge. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data.

## Data We Access

KCS Pro requires the following permissions to function:
- **Read Confluence content**: To analyze pages for staleness, readability, and completeness
- **Read space information**: To scan knowledge bases
- **Write confluence content**: To add analysis badges to pages
- **App storage**: To store scan results, settings, and historical data

## Data We Store

All data is stored within Atlassian's Forge infrastructure on your Confluence instance:
- Scan results and health scores
- Page analysis metadata (readability scores, completeness metrics)
- Agent flags and comments
- AI provider settings (API keys are encrypted)
- Historical tracking data (baseline, last scan, current scan)

**We do NOT:**
- Store data outside your Confluence instance
- Share data with third parties
- Use your data for any purpose other than providing the app functionality
- Access your data unless you explicitly run a scan

## AI Provider Data

If you use AI analysis features:
- You provide your own API key for your chosen provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, Azure)
- Page content is sent to your AI provider for analysis
- We do not store AI provider API keys in plain text (encrypted at rest)
- Review your AI provider's privacy policy for their data handling

## Data Retention

- Scan data: Stored until you delete it manually or uninstall the app
- Historical tracking: 90 days for paid plans, 30 days for free tier
- All data is deleted when you uninstall KCS Pro

## Data Security

- Built on Atlassian Forge, which is SOC 2 Type II certified
- All data encrypted at rest and in transit
- API keys stored with Forge's secure storage
- No data leaves Atlassian infrastructure (except AI API calls if you enable that feature)

## Your Rights

You can:
- Request data deletion by uninstalling the app
- Export your data through Confluence's standard export features
- Contact us for data-related questions
